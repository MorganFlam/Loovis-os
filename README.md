# LoovisOS

**LoovisOS** is an independent, open-source operating system designed specifically for kids. It's the foundation of **Loovis** — a safe, low-cost, durable mobile device that empowers children while giving parents peace of mind.

## 🚸 Why LoovisOS?

Today’s phones weren’t made for kids. Parental controls are tacked on. Surveillance and ads are baked in. LoovisOS starts fresh — with an operating system built from the ground up to be:

- Simple
- Ethical
- Non-commercial
- Built for safety, not surveillance

---

## 🌱 Our Vision

A world where every child’s first phone is:
- Durable and affordable
- Completely ad-free
- Curated only with parent-approved apps
- Built with privacy and simplicity at its core

**Loovis** isn’t just a device — it’s a movement for family-first tech.

---

## 🧱 Core Principles

- **Kid-first design** – No ads. No addictive loops. A calm, simple interface.
- **Parent-powered curation** – Every app must pass a parental review board before being made available.
- **Completely independent** – Not based on Android or iOS. LoovisOS is built from scratch with full transparency.
- **Open but protected** – The code is open. Commercial use is not.
- **Community-led** – Built with feedback from parents, developers, and educators.
